# Shielded Metal Arc Welding
### Process
This process uses an electrode to create a plasma arc, this electrode is consumed in the process. A current flows directly from the electrode to the [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) creating [plasma](Plasma%20Working.md) at the contacts. This plasma melts the metal locally, allowing for great precision. As the weld is created the coating of the electrode vaporizes and coats the metal to protect the weld from corrosive processes, which also creates an unwanted layer of slag[^arc].
##### Similar Processes
This process is similar to [TIG welding](TIG%20Welding.md), but it consumes the electrode in the process, and no gasses are needed to shield the plasma flow, and it's a variation of [MAG welding](MAG%20and%20MIG%20Welding.md), where the corrosion protective coating is formed by a gas release instead.
This is the most popular welding process worldwide.

### Characteristics
This process is for __electrically conductive metals__ only.
This process comes with a lot of [heat induced property alteration](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md).
##### Positive
- This process allows the welder a great deal of control, resulting in stronger, more consistent welds.
- This method requires no gas release.
- This process allows for filling in and correcting mistakes in the production process.
##### Negative
- This method requires electrically conductive metals.
- This process produces slag on the weld.
- This process has a big [heat affected zone](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#hot%20deformation).
- This process can create significant [thermal distortion](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation).
