# Drawing
### Process
The general process of drawing involves forcing the [billet](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) through a [die](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) by pulling on the billet. This process is the reciprocal of [Extrusion](Extrusion.md). It can, however, only be done __cold__.
An example of a product made by drawing are metal wires. Think copper wires in cables etc[^draw].
