# Injection Molding
### Process
The injection molding process involves pouring a liquid, or softened plastic emulsion into a metal [mold](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) where it cools off quick. The products are ejected quickly[^injmold]. [Stork IMM](https://www.storkimm.nl/) for example has a cycle time of around _3 seconds_.

### Characteristics
This process is for __plastics__ only. It suits _thermoplasts_, _thermosets_ and _elastomers_. The metal suitable version of this process is [die casting](Die%20Casting.md).
##### Positive
- This process has fast cycle times and multiple products can be created at once.
- This process produces accurate products.
- The products from this process have good accuracy.
##### Negative
- This process is limited by the shapes it can produce.
- This process is limited by the size of the products it can produce.
- Expensive
