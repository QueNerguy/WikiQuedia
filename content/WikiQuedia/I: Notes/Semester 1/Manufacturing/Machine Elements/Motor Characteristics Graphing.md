# Motor Characteristics Graphing
### Motor Energy Characteristics
When designing a motor it is important to consider the power it can output to evaluate whether it suits your application. The [Power](Power.md) a motor outputs depends on the current [Torque](Torque.md) and [rotational velocity](rotational%20velocity).
In the image below th blue E is the energy characteristic of the _motor_, and the red L the characteristic of the _load_ and the resistance it gives. Power would stay the same for every point in the graph for the motor if $T$ and $\omega$ increase at a constant rate, resulting in a straight line. Since it doesn't, the power changes and is different at almost every point on the graphs.

The graphs dont intersect
