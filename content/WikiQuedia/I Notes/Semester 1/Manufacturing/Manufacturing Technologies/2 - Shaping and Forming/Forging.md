# Forging
### Process
In forging a material is formed by applying compressive forces. This can be done either by hitting a material with a hammer, or pressing it with a [die](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation).
This process can create significantÂ [thermal distortion](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation).
#### Methods
##### Hot forging
Hot forging requires less force than [cold forging](#cold%20forging) because the high temperature softens the metal. Because [recrystallization](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#hot%20deformation) is possible at elevated temperatures, hot forged products have good grain and stress flow[^flow], but in turn do have a rougher surface.
The [deformation](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md) is achieved by a combination of reordening the crystals and [straining](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#Cold%20Property%20Alteration) the metal like in [cold forging](#cold%20forging).
##### Cold forging
Cold forging requires a lot of force to [deform](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md) the material. It is usually done through hammering the workpiece exclusively. The deformation is only achieved by [straining](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#Cold%20Property%20Alteration) the metal instead of reordening the crystal structure as in [hot forging](#hot%20forging).
#### Types
##### Open Die Forging
Two [dies](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) press down on the workpiece without ever closing, this mostly squishes the material. Usually these look and work like giant stamps.
##### Closed Die Forging
Two [dies](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) press down on the workpiece and close at the end of the operation, forming the workpiece to fit the inside of the die. This process usually leaves [flash](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation.) on the edges and thus wastes material.
##### Heading
This process is closely related to [closed die forging](#closed%20die%20forging). The operation mostly only increases the cross section of a workpiece by pushing it into a _closed [die](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation)_. This process is used for example for giving a screw a head. 
##### Coining
This process is closely related to [open die forging](#open%20die). The operation involves stamping a pattern into a workpiece with an _open [die](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation)_.

### Characteristics
This process is for __metals__ only.
