# Crystals
### Definition
A crystal is identifiable by the regular structure of it's atoms. It is built off of a repeating highly ordered pattern, a _[crystal lattice](#lattices)_ that extends in all directions.

### Lattices
A lattice is a framework, made up of [unit cells](#unit%20cells), that forms the entirety of a crystal, if that crystal is perfect. Deformations %%==LINKJE NAAR BURGERS OFZO==%% and dislocations are not considered here. The unit cells are the repeating _parts_ in a crystal, the lattice is the _repetition itself_. When constructing a lattice out of unit cells, keep in mind that unit cells cannot be rotated to fill a lattice[^lattice1][^lattice2].

### Unit Cells
Unit cells are the repeating parts in a crystal, they are made up of atoms filling out a geometric shape in 3D space. When unit cells are arranged in a [lattice](#lattices) they form the complete crystal. Calculations on a unit cell can be extrapolated to explain behaviors of the whole material. Unit cells __cannot__ be rotated to fill a lattice, this would impede the extrapolation of it's properties.
#### Types of Unit Cell
A _[crystal lattice](#lattices)_  is divided into different _[unit cells](#unit%20cells)_. These unit cells are usually cubic and sometimes hexagonal in nature.
##### Cubic
These [unit cells](#unit%20cells) have the same height as they have width. This cell length is usually denoted with _a_.
1. ___Fcc:___ <u>F</u>ace <u>C</u>entered <u>C</u>ubic. This unit cell has an atom in each corner and one on every face. The unit cell has $8$ corners (with each an $\frac18$th of an atom in them), and $6$ faces (with $\frac12$ an atom on them), so __$4$__ atoms per cell. This is the most closed packed cubic unit cell, and it has the same density as the [hcp](#hexagonal) unit cell. It's _atomic packing_[^at.pack] is $0.740$[^cube_wiki].
2. ___Bcc:___ <u>B</u>ody <u>C</u>entered <u>C</u>ubic. This unit cell has an atom in each corner and one in the center. The unit cell has $8$ corners (with each a $\frac18$th of an atom in them), and $1$ center (with a whole atom in it), so __$2$__ atoms per cell. This is a less dense packing than the _fcc_ above. It's _atomic packing_[^at.pack] is $0.680$[^cube_wiki].
##### Hexagonal
These [unit cells](#unit%20cells) are based on a hexagon, but are usually simplified to a sheared square as seen from above. This is because a hexagon can be subdivided into 'diamonds', a rhomboid[^rhombus_wiki] or parallegram-shape[^para_wiki]. These unit cells have an _interior angle_ ($\gamma$) of $120\textdegree$. Their height (_a_)and cell length (_c_) can be different.
1. ___Hexagonal:___ This unit cell has just an atom in each corner. The unit cell has $8$ corners (with an average of an $\frac18$th of an atom in them), so $1$ atom per cell. This is a less dense packing than the _hcp_ below. 
2. ___Hcp:___ <u>H</u>exagonal <u>C</u>lose <u>P</u>acked. This atom has an atom This unit cell has an atom in each corner and one in the center (or three if you look at the full hexagonal structure). The unit cell has $8$ corners (with each an avarege of an $\frac18$th of an atom in them), and $1$ center (with a whole atom in it), so __$2$__ atoms per cell. Because of the _interior angle_ though the corner packing is more dense, giving it the same density as the [fcc](#Cubic) unit cell. It's _atomic packing_[^at.pack] is $0.740$[^hex_wiki].
