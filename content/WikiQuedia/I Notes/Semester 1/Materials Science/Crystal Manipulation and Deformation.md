# Crystal Manipulation
### Cold Deformation
When a metal is cold deformed it's [crystal](Crystals.md) is stretched, leaving a hardened product and a smooth finish. 
#### Cold: Property Alteration
This deformation increases the _[yield strength](Yield%20Strength.md)_, but decreases the amount elongation it has before fracture, making it more brittle[^brittle]. This also reduces the amount of energy it can absorb, lowering it's toughness. The _[Modulus of Elasticity](Modulus%20of%20Elasticity.md)_ ($E$) is unchanged.
> [!abstract] Notice
> This process is sometimes also referred to as "_strain hardening_", where straining a material results in a harder or harder to bend end-product. This happens when bending metal wires for example. It is hard to bend them back until they're straight, because un-bent parts of the wire deform easier and will therefore bend instead.

### Hot Deformation
When a metal is hot deformed it's [crystal](Crystals.md) is first stretched, but the heat allows for recrystallization after the deformation. In this process the crystals will shrink in size, increasing the ductility[^duck] and leaving a rough finish. 
#### Hot: Property Alteration
Becauses the material recrystallizes during hot processes stress flow[^flow] in the grains is improved. Dislocations can move and annihilate with each other decreasing local stress buildups and irregular stress concentrations. This recrystallization reduces the _[yield strength](Yield%20Strength.md)_, but increases the amount of [Strain](Strain.md) the material can absorb before fracture, making it more ductile[^duck]. This also increases the amount of energy it can absorb, increasing it's toughness. The _[Modulus of Elasticity](Modulus%20of%20Elasticity.md)_ ($E$) can change depending on the temperature. %%==extra info vanuit ijzer vorming processen enzo==%%
