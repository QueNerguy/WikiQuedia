# Power Bed Fusion
### Process
Power bed fusion (PBF) is a [3D printing](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) process where a powder is jetted onto the base, and then molten or [sintered](Sintering.md) together to form one cohesive structure with either a laser, a heated print-head, or an electron beam.
Melting processes - for example SLM for <u>S</u>elective <u>L</u>aser _<u>M</u>elting_ - produce stronger parts than sintering processes - for example SLS for <u>S</u>elective <u>L</u>aser _<u>S</u>intering_.
Heated print-head processes are only suitable for metals, not for plastics.
Because this method is relatively inexpensive, like [fused deposition modeling](FDM%20-%20Fused%20Deposition%20Modeling.md), this process is very suitable for prototyping.
### Characteristics
This process is for __metals and plastics__ only. Plastics are excluded from heater based processes though.
##### Positive
- This method never requires supports.
- This method is inexpensive compared to other [additive manufacturing](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) processes.
- This process supports a lot of different materials.
##### Negative
- This process operates at a relatively low speed.
- This process is limited by the size of the products it can produce.
- This process does not possess the same strengths as [cast](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#1%20-%20casting) or [forged](Forging.md) products, for example, have.
- This process can produce a rough finish, depending on the grain of the powder.
