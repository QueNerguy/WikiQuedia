# SLA- Stereolithography
### Process
<u>S</u>tereo<u>l</u>ithogr<u>a</u>phy, also known as _vat polymerization_ is a [3D printing](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) process where a laser hardens a polymer-solution to create the end-product. The process uses a vat with a table that moves through a basin, filled entirely with a polymer. The height of the table determines the workheight of the laser, so as the print progresses, with every layer, the table moves further from the top of the basin. A laser moves in the horizontal plane to harden the polymer and do the individual 2D layers themselves[^ijsberg].

### Characteristics
This process is for __polymers__ only.
##### Positive
- This process has the best finish of all 3D printing technologies.
- The strength of the product is not direction dependent.
##### Negative
- The properties of the product change with time due to the nature of polymers.
- This process requires supports for the printing of certain parts.
