# Design Rules Shaping and Forming
When deforming the [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) is at risk for warping and other manufacturing problems. To avoid abide by the following design guidelines:
1. 
> [!check] Even Width
> The product should have even width across across walls.

2. 
> [!check] No Sharp Edges
> The product should not have sharp edges, round them off instead by using fillets for example. <br>Sharp edges may cause warping in the eventual product.

3. 
> [!check] Balanced Voids
> When designing voids or holes in the product, make sure they have equivalent sizes. 

4. 
> [!check] No Big Empty Sheets
> Don't leave big empty flat planes on a product. Reinforce them with ribs instead. Big surfaces are subject to warping and bending, but ribs can negate this effect by reinforcing the [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation).
