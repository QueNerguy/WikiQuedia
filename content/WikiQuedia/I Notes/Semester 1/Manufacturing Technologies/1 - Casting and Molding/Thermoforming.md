# Thermoforming
### Process
A thin plastic sheet is spread over a workpiece to form a finish. The workpiece, then, functions as the [pattern](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation). To form the finish the plastic is sucked to the surface of the pattern and vacuum sealed.

### Characteristics
This process is for __plastic__ only. %%I dont know which plastics are suited for this :(%%
##### Positive
- This process can be very fast with cycle times of around a few seconds.
- Low cost
##### Negative
- Wall thickness cannot vary and is dictated by the original sheet thickness.
