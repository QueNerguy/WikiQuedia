# Die Casting
### Process
The injection molding process involves pouring liquid metal into a metal [mold](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) where it cools off[^diecasting].
This process is susceptible to many modes of failure. Most notably cracking in edges, not adhering to the mold shape and unforeseen stress concentrations. For solutions see the [design guidelines page](Design%20Rules%20Casting.md).

### Characteristics
This process is for __metals__ only. The plastic suitable version of this process is [Injection Molding](Injection%20Molding.md).
##### Positive
- This process has fast cycle times and multiple products can be created at once.
- This process produces accurate products.
- The products from this process have good accuracy.
##### Negative
- This process is limited by the shapes it can produce.
- This process is limited by the size of the products it can produce.
- Expensive
