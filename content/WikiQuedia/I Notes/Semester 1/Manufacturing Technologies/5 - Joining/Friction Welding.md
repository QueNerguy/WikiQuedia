# Friction Welding
### Process
Two shafts rotate in opposite direction of one another in a machine akin to a [turning table](Physical%20Machining%20Methods.md#turning).
The heat of the friction melts the metals and joins them together.
### Characteristics
This process is for __metals__ only.
This process comes with a lot of [heat induced property alteration](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md).
##### Positive
- This method of welding creates very strong and consistent welds.
- The welds created by this process are very clean and require little [grinding](Physical%20Machining%20Methods.md#grinding) to make the shafts uniform in diameter over the weld.
##### Negative
- This method has a big [heat affected zone](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md).
