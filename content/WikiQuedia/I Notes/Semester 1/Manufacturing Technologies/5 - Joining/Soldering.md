# Soldering
### Process
Soldering is a joining method that is very similar to [Brazing](Brazing.md), in that only the _filler metal_ melts to form the joint. It's a low strength, low cost solution when welding two materials together. The only requirement for soldering a material is that the material has a higher melting point than the filler metal[^sold].

### Characteristics
This process is suitable for __all materials with a high enough melting point__.
##### Positive
- This method can operate at a high speed.
- This process is inexpensive.
- This process has a negligible [heat affected zone](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#hot%20deformation).
- This process produces negligible [thermal distortion](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation).
##### Negative
- This process produces very low strength joints.
