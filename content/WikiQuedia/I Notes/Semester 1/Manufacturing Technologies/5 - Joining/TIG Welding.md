# TIG Welding
### Process
<u>T</u>ungsten <u>I</u>nert <u>G</u>as welding, or gas tungten arc welding, uses an electrode of tungsten, which is not consumed, to create a [plasma arc](Plasma%20Working.md). A current flows from the electrode to the [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation), through an electrically conductive gas, creating plasma where it flows. This plasma melts the metal locally, allowing for great precision.
##### Similar Processes
This process is very similar to [Shielded Metal Arc Welding](Shielded%20Metal%20Arc%20Welding.md), but it does not consume the electrode, and the electrode and the [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) don't make direct contact. In TIG the electrons - and therefore the plasma arc - are guided through the gas instead.

### Characteristics
This process is for __electrically conductive metals__ only.
##### Positive
- This process allows the welder a great deal of control, resulting in stronger, more consistent welds.
##### Negative
- This method requires electrically conductive metals.
- This method is relatively slow.
- This process requires gas release.
- This process has a big [heat affected zone](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#hot%20deformation).
- This process can create significant [thermal distortion](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation).
