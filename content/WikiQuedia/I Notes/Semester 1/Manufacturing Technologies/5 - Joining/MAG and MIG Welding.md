# MAG and MIG Welding
### Process
 <u>M</u>etal <u>A</u>ctive <u>G</u>as and <u>M</u>etal <u>I</u>nert <u>G</u>as welding are welding processes that use a consumable electrode to create [plasma](Plasma%20Working.md) upon contact with the [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation). This plasma melts the metal locally, allowing for great precision. A coating is formed by the gas on the weld to protect it form reacting with the atmosphere. Depending on the metal type a different gas is used. Inert gasses like helium are used for non-ferrous metals, but for ferrous metals like steels carbon based gasses are used because they can penetrate the weld better allowing for better corrosion resistance[^magmig].
##### Similar Processes
This process is similar to [TIG welding](TIG%20Welding.md), but the gas is not needed to strike a plasma contact. The electrode itself is also consumed here and not with TIG welding, and it's a variation of [Shielded Metal Arc Welding](Shielded%20Metal%20Arc%20Welding.md), where the corrosion protective coating is formed by a vaporizing layer on the electrode instead. This method of welding, however, does not form a layer of slag on top of the weld.
### Characteristics
This process is for __electrically conductivemetals__ only.
This process comes with a lot of [heat induced property alteration](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md).

##### Positive
- This process allows the welder a great deal of control, resulting in stronger, more consistent welds.
- This method requires no gas shielding.
- This process allows for filling in and correcting mistakes in the production process.
- This process does not produce slag on the weld.
##### Negative
- This method requires electrically conductive metals.
- This process requires gas release.
- This process has a big [heat affected zone](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#hot%20deformation).
- This process can create significant [thermal distortion](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation).
