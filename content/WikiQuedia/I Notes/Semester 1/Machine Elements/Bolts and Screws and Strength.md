# Bolts and Screws and Strength
Connecting two parts instead of making them from one piece through a metal working process like [machining](physical%20machining%20methods) or [forging](forging)[^methods] almost always sacrifices in strength.

Bolts and screws both work in the same way. The only difference between the two is that screws are made to insert into a part, bolts also leave the part. They therefore need to be secured at the other end by a nut. <br>![[BoltsVSscrews_80%.png|300]]<br>
### Common Terms
- $p$: The pitch of a screw or bolt. The pitch is the distance between two peaks of the thread. If a screw has two threads going up it's side, the pitch is half the distance between a whole revolution of the thread (the lead), a third for three threads etc.
- $L$: The lead of a screw or bolt. The lead is the distance between two whole revolutions of the thread. If there's three threads the lead is three times the pitch.
- $D$ or $d$: The nominal diameter of the bolt or screw. These are used interchangibly in engineering practice for some reason. I will use only $D$ when addressing the major diameter here. The major diameter is the outside diameter of a screw or hole, or the inside diameter of a hole. Because of this an M6 whole and bolt will fit together. The M grade gives the major diameter.<br>-> M6 for example has a major diameter of 6 mm.

### Strength Values
The strength of these parts is usually written on their heads iwth two values[^bolthead]. It is also always listed somewhere by the manufacturer. 
##### Getting Strength Values From the Head
1. __Minimum [tensile strength](tensile%20strength)__: The first value gives the minimum tensile strength ($\sigma_{T}$) in 100 \[MPa]. 
> [!Example] Concretely
>The general formula is: _First value $\cdot 100$ \[MPa]_.<br>A grade value of __<u>9</u>__.8 gives a tensile strength: <br>-> $9\cdot 100 \textrm{ [MPa]}$ = 900 MPa.

2. __Minimum [yield strength](yield%20strength)__: The second value helps calculate the minimum yield strength ($\sigma_{Y}$).
> [!Example] Concretely
>The general formula is: _Second value $\cdot$ Tensile strength_ ($\sigma_{T}$). <br>A grade value of 9.__<u>8</u>__ gives a yield strength: <br>-> $0.8 \cdot \sigma_{T}=0.8\cdot 900 \textrm{ [MPa]}$ = 720 \[MPa].

### Preloading
Bolts are basically always preloaded. Preloading a bolt means tightening the bolt after it already makes contact with the surface of the part. This counteracts loosening of the bolt under dynamic loading, and greatly increases the amount of force a bolt can take.
##### Working Mechanism
[Good explainer video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLzTB4KLCxU)<br>To understand how preloading increases the amount of strength a bolt can take, we must consider them and the parts they insert into as springs. When the bolt tightens, the part around it compresses a bit while the bolt stretches a bit. <br>If a load now acts on the parts, pulling them apart, the parts will decompress while the bolt gets stretched even further. Because the parts decompress, the load on the bolt due to the preloading will decrease and it will only absorb a part of the external load. The other part of the external load is absorbed by the stretching parts. This allows a bolt to be loaded more, as it only absorbs part of the external load.
If a load acts parallel to the parts, trying to get the parts to slide along one another, preloading helps too. In this case there is a friction force between the two parts because the bolt forces them together. In this case too, only a part of the external load is absorbed by the bolt. The other part of the external load is absorbed by the friction between the plates, which allows the bolt to be loaded way more than without preloading. 
- The load on the bolt ($Q$) can be calculated with:
$$
Q=Q_{p}+\frac{k_{b}}{k_{b}+k_{m}}\cdot F
$$
See [here](load%20on%20a%20preloaded%20bolt) the unit explanation.
- The torque ($T$) required to achieve this preload is:
$$
T \approx 0.2 \cdot Q_p \cdot D
$$
See [here](required%20torque%20for%20given%20preload) the unit explanation.
#### Calculating Appropriate Preloads
Depending on the type of load that the bolts will be subjected to the required preload will change. Sometimes in dynamical loading situations even a preload will not be enough, and special washers, different bolts or adhesive processes need to be applied too. <br>There's 4 ways a bolt can be loaded, they are described as seen from the bolt. An axial load, for example, is caused by a force normal to the surface of the part.
##### 1: Axial Loads
In axial loads the force acting on the part is divided by how many bolts carry the load to get the external force acting on the bolt.
$$
F=\frac{F_{\sum}}{\textrm{z}}
$$

##### 2: Transverse Loads


##### 3: Torque


##### 4: Overturning Moment





### Strength in Bolted Connections
To make sure bolts don't fail stress analysis is critical to make sure bolts don't exceed their maximum strength and make the whole assembly fail. <br>One option to help the bolt withstand higher loads is to increase the length of engagement ($L_e$).
$$
L_{e} \ge \frac{\sigma_{\textrm{T}_{\textrm{bolt}}}}{\sigma_{\textrm{T}_{\textrm{nut}}}}\cdot\frac{2A_{\textrm{eff}}}{0.5\pi\left(D-0.64952\cdot p\right)}
$$
See [here](length%20of%20engagement%20of%20bolt) the unit explanation.<br>
#### Equivalent Stress in Bolts
In general there are two formulas to calculate the stress on a bolt, one for a bolt with, and one for a bolt without preload. The only thing that changes in this formula, if the way the bolt is loaded changes, is the load on the bolt $Q$.
The general equations are:
- The stress in a bolt, __with__ preloading:
$$
\sigma_{\textrm{ca}}=\frac{1.3\cdot Q}{A_{\textrm{eff}}\approx\frac14\pi D^2}
$$
See [here](combined%20stress%20in%20a%20bolt%20with%20preload.md) the unit explanation.
- The stress in a bolt, __without__ preloading:
$$
\sigma_{\textrm{ca}} = \sigma = \frac{Q}{A_{\textrm{eff}}\approx\frac14\pi D^2}
$$
See [here](combined%20stress%20in%20a%20bolt%20without%20preload.md) the unit explanation. <br>Always make sure that $\sigma_{\textrm{ca}}$ does not exceed design guidelines, and above all, does not exceed the [tensile strength](tensile%20strength) limit.

#### Crushing Stress due to Shear Loading
When a bolt is loaded in shear, or otherwise crushed by the material it is inserted into, the bolt (or part in rare cases) can fail due to crushing. The stress in this case is applicable to all bolts, precision bolted joints too, and is referred to as _crushing stress_ or _bearing stress_. The equation is as follows:
$$\sigma_{p}=\frac{F_{\textrm{shear}}}{d_0 L_{\min}}$$
See [here](crushing%20or%20bearing%20stress%20in%20bolts.md) the unit explanation.


> [!example] More Concretely
> In the below clevis-blade arrangement the flow of the force $P$ is shown in the parts. The pin is crushed at the whole area from $b$ to $c$. In this scenario $F_{\textrm{shear}}$ = $P$. <br>The length the shear force acts on has two values, either $b$ + $c$, for the force $P$ on the clevice, or the length between $b$ and $c$, let's call it $a$, for the force $P$ on the blade. Since the length of $a$ is smaller than that of $b$ and $c$, we choose length $a$ for $L_{\min}$.
