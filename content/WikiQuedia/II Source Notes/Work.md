#### Synopsis:
Work is the amount of energy generated by a force over a distance. When throwing a ball your arm only does work when it is in contact with the ball. It does this work over the distance of your throw. 
If a force is not perpendicular to the direction of movement only the component in the direction of movement does work.
$$
W=\vec{F}\cdot s
$$
or in the case of a non-straight path, where $\textbf{F}$ may be a function of the path $s$:
$$
W=\int\vec{F}\cdot\mathrm{d}s
$$
- This applies in cases where for example the force stays straight but the path curves off. F gets smaller as the angle between the force and the direction of the path gets smaller.
