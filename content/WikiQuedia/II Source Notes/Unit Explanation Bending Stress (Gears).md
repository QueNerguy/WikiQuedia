- $\sigma _b$ = Maximum bending stress. The bending stress changes as the place of contact at the teeth changes, which is why the correction factors $\textrm{Y}$ are needed.
- $K$ = Load factor. If this is not given, assume $K$ = 1.
- $F_{t}$ = Tangential force, evaluated at the pitch circle/diameter.
- $b$ = Gear width.
- $m$ = Gear modulus. More on that [here](gears#module).
- $Y_{\textrm{Fa}}$ = Form correction factor.
- $Y_{\textrm{Sa}}$ = Stress concentration correction factor.
