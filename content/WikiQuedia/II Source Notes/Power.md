#### Synopsis:
Power is a measure of how much [work energy](Work.md) is exerted by an energy source per unit of time. 
$$P=\vec{F}\cdot \vec{v}$$
- with:
	- $F$ = [Force](Force.md)
	- $v$ = velocity

In the case of a rotation, like in a motor:
$$
P=\vec{T}\cdot \vec{\omega}
$$
- with:
	- $T$ = [Torque](Torque.md)
	- $\omega$ = [Angular velocity](Angular%20Velocity.md)

It can also be measured by the amount of electrical energy is used:
$$P=I\cdot V$$
- with:
	- $I$ = Electrical current %%SOURCE AANMAKEN OWO%%
	- $V$ = Voltage %%SOURCE%%
