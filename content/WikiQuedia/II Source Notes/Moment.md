#### Synopsis:
A moment ($M$) measures an object's tendency to rotate. A $0$ moment means there's no [Angular Acceleration](Angular%20Acceleration.md), so the object either doesn't rotate, or rotates at a constant [speed](Angular%20Velocity.md). Statically these situations are equivalent. 
A moment is the equivalent of a [force](Force.md) in a rotational motion. 
Usually a distinguishment is made between moments and [torques](Torque.md), but physically they act the same on an object. A moment either __1:__ bends the object, or __2:__ is a rotation caused by forces over a distance.
$$\vec{M}=\vec{r}\times \vec{F}$$
This equation works the same for non-vector math, just remove the arrows, and the $r$ and $F$ can be switched around.
Keep in mind that the moment is maximal at a $90\degree$ angle and $0$ if the direction of force is the same direction of the length. The formal equation would therefore be:
$$M=r\cdot F\sin\left(\theta\right)$$
It is better to just solve these problems based on the geometry on the spot instead of memorizing this rule.
