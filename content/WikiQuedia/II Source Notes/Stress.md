#### Synopsis:
Stress is a measure of [force](force) per unit area. Like force describes an objects tendency to move, stress measures the objects tendency to deform. In the case of _normal stress_ the object will change volume, in the case of _shear stress_ the object will [shear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_mapping), in the case of _torsional stress_ the object will twist.
If a force that deforms an object is spread over a large surface, the stress will decrease with area. This allows the object to withstand a bigger force before [yielding](yield%20strength).
