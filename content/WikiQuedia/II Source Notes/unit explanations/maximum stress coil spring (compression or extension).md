- $\tau_{max}$ = The maximum stress reached on the area of a slice of the coil wire. The maximum stress is $\tau$, because the stress in the spring is torsional, which is caused by _[shear stresses](stress)_. $\tau_{max}$ is the maximum shear stress, which occurs at the surface of the wire, at the exterior of the coil.
- $K_\textrm{w}$ = The Wahl factor. This is a corrective factor used to calculate the maximum stress. The reason this factor is needed is because the stress on a slice of the spring is not constant, it gets bigger towards the exterior of the spring. The Wahl factor corrects for this.
- $F$ = The [force](force) that causes the spring to elongate or compress. This force has to be in-line with the spring, or the formula doesn't hold.
- $C$ = The spring index.
$$
C = \frac{D}{d}

See [here](spring%20basics#disambiguation) for extra disambiguation regarding the $D$ and $d$.
- $d$ = The diameter of the wire of the spring.
