- $F_\max$ = The maximum force generated by the torque.
- $T$ = The torque acting on the part or assembly.
- $r_\max$ = The distance from the location where the torque acts to the bolt furthest away from this point.
- $\textrm{z}$ = The amount of bolts on the part or assembly.
- $\sum_{i=1}^{\textrm{z}}r_{i}^2$ = The sum of the distances between the bolts and the torque squared. <br><br>The way this sum operates is as follows:  <br>__1__. It starts at $i$ = 1. bolt 1 has it's radius squared. $r_{1}^2$.<br>__2__. Then at $i$ = 2, bolt 2 has it's radius squared. $r_{2}^2$. This is then added to the result of the first.<br>__3__. Then at $i$ = 3, bolt 3 has it's radius squared. $r_{3}^2$. This is then added to the value acquired at step __2__. <br>__4__.This process continues until all $\textrm{z}$ bolts have been indexed and added together.
