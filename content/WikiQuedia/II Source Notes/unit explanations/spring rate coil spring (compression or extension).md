- $k$ = The spring rate.
- $G$ = The [shear modulus](shear%20modulus).
- $d$ = The diameter of the wire of the spring.
- $n$ = The number of active coils. These are the coils that actually do work, a spring might have a few that don't, to help with mounting etc.<br>[Explainer on counting them](https://www.acxesspring.com/counting-active-coils.html)
- $D$ = The mean diameter of the coil. This is the diameter of the coil measured at half the wire thickness. -> outside diameter - the wire thickness. This is the mean of $D_i$ and $D_o$.
- $C$ = The spring index.
$$
C = \frac{D}{d}
