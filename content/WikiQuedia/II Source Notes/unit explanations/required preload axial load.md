- $Q_p$ = The required preload on the bolt.
- $c_{\textrm{connection}}$ = The connection type coefficient. <br> -> $c_{\textrm{connection}}$ = 0.75 for connections requiring reuse. <br> ->$c_{\textrm{connection}}$ = 0.89 for permanent connections.
- $A_{\textrm{eff}}$ = The effictive area of the bolt. Officially this is supposed to be a function of the inner diameter of the bolt, but it can be decently approximated using the major diameter.
- $\sigma_\textrm{proof}$ = The proof strength. This is a function of the [yield strength](yield%20strength). <br> -> Typically 85% of $\sigma_Y$ is used.
- $F$ = The part of the force the bolt takes.
