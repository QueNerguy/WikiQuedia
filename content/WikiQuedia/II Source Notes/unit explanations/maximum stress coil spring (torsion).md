- $\sigma_{max}$ = The maximum stress reached on the area of a slice of the coil wire.
- $K_\textrm{wT}$ = The Wahl factor for torsion springs. This is a corrective factor used to calculate the maximum stress. The reason this factor is needed is because the stress on a slice of the spring is not constant. The Wahl factor corrects for this.
- $T$ = The applied [torque](torque) or [moment](moment).
- $d$ = The diameter of the wire of the spring.
