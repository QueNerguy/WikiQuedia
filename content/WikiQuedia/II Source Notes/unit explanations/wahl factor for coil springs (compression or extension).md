- $K_\textrm{w}$ = The Wahl factor. This is a corrective factor used to calculate the maximum stress. The reason this factor is needed is because the stress on a slice of the spring is not constant, it gets bigger towards the exterior of the spring. The Wahl factor corrects for this.
- $C$ = The spring index.

C = \frac{D}{d}
