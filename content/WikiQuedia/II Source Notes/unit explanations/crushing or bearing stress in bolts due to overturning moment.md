- $\sigma_{p,\max}$ = The crushing or bearing stress.
- $Q_p$ = The required preload on the bolt.
- $A_{\textrm{eff}}$ = The effictive area of the bolt-head. This area is the surface under the head of the bolt, which can be approximated by measuring the diameter $d_h$ of the head, and using the major diameter $D$ of the bolt to calculate the area. <br> -> $A_{\textrm{eff}} = \frac{1}{4}\pi \cdot (d_h - D)$
- $M$ = The moment acting on the part or assembly.
- $W$ = The section modulus of the contact surface. <br>-> $W = \frac{I}{L}$[^W]
	- with:
		- $I$ = The [area moment of inertia](area%20moment%20of%20inertia) of the surface.
		- $L$ = The distance from the axis the overturning moment acts on to the bolt.
