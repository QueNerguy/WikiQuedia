- $k_\phi$ = The torsional spring rate. The $\phi$ is there to signal that it works over an angle $\phi$.
- $T$ = The applied [torque](torque) or [moment](moment).
- $\phi$ = The angle the spring was displaced.
- $E$ = The [elastic modulus](Modulus%20of%20Elasticity.md).
- $I$ = The [area moment of inertia](area%20moment%20of%20inertia), or second moment of area. This represents an object's resistance against bending/deformation, due to it's geometry, in the same way that mass inertia gives an object resistance against movement[^inert]. 
- $D$ = The mean diameter of the coil. This is the diameter of the coil measured at half the wire thickness. -> outside diameter - the wire thickness. This is the mean of $D_i$ and $D_o$.
- $n$ = The number of active coils. These are the coils that actually do work, a spring might have a few that don't, to help with mounting etc.<br>[Explainer on counting them](https://www.acxesspring.com/counting-active-coils.html).
