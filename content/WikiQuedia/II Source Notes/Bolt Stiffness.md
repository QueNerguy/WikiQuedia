#### Synopsis:
The stiffness of a bolt can be deduced from the parallel connection of springs, and is as follows:
$$
k_b = \frac{A\cdot E}{L_e}
$$
- with:
	- $k_b$ = The stiffness of the bolt.
	- $A$ = The effective area of the bolt. This can be approximated by $A \approx \frac{1}{4} \cdot d^2$, where $d$ is the nominal diameter of the bolt.
	- $E$ = The [modulus of elasticity.](modulus%20of%20elasticity)
	- $L_e$ = The length of engagement. This is the length of the part of the bolt that's inserted into the parts.
