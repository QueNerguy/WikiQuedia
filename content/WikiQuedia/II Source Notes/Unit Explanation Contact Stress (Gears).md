- $\sigma_{H}$ = Maximum contact stress. The contact stress changes as the place of contact at the teeth changes, which is why the correction factors $\textrm{Z}$ are needed.
- $Z_{H}$ = Curvature correction factor. Take this from a table. Usual value = 2.5 for standard spur gears
- $Z_{E}$ = Elasticity correction factor. Take this from a table. 
$$
Z_{E}=\sqrt{0.175\cdot E}
$$
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp -> $E$ = [Elastic modulus](young's%20modulus)
- $K$ = Load factor. If this is not given, assume $K$ = 1.
- $F_{t}$ = Tangential force, evaluated at the pitch circle/diameter.
- $b$ = Gear width.
- $d$ = Pitch diameter = $d_p$.
- $u$ = Teeth ratio. Similar to reduction ratio, only it can't be smaller than one.
$$
u=\frac{\textrm{z}_1}{\textrm{z}_2}\ge1
