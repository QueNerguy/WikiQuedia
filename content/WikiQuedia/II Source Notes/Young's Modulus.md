#### Synopsis:
The Young's modulus, or the Elastic modulus ($E$) measures how much a material will elongate at a certain amount of stress. The higher the Young's modulus, the more stress a material can withstand while elongating the same amount, resulting in a high _stiffness_. The Young's modulus is the slope of the _elastic part of the curve_. 
The Young's modulus holds only for metal deformation where the product springs back to it's original shape after the operation.

- $E$ increases: stiffness increases.
