#### Synopsis:
Angular acceleration ($\boldsymbol{\alpha}$, or $\dot{\boldsymbol{\omega}}$ and $\ddot{\boldsymbol{s}}$ as time derivatives) measures acceleration around an axis as a rotation, or alternatively, the _rate of change with respect to time_ of [Angular Velocity](Angular%20Velocity.md). An object will always rotate around it's [Instant Centre of Rotation](Instant%20Centre%20of%20Rotation.md), no matter where the angular accaleration acts, as long as it is subjected to _pure rotation_. Having only _angular_ acceleration acting on a body causes pure rotation.
