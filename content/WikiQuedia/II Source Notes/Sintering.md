#### Synopsis:
Sintering is a process that can be used for, among others: metals, plastics and ceramics, where a material is heated to below it's melting temperature, but still hot enough that it will fuse with other parts. This process works by making the atoms diffuse with other parts through their contact, bonding the two materials. 
This process is used to connect powders or loose materials.
