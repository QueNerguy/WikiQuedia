# Sheet Metal Forming
### Process
Sheet metal is formed by compressing a metal with big rollers until it reaches the desired thickness. This process usually happens in a few steps, meaning the metal moves through a few rollers subsequently until it meets the specifications.
#### Methods
##### Hot Rolling
Hot rolling requires less torque than [cold rolling](#cold%20rolling) because the high temperature softens the metal. Because [recrystallization](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#hot%20deformation) is possible at elevated temperatures, hot rolled products are more ductile, but in turn have a rougher surface.
The [deformation](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md) is achieved by a combination of reordening the crystals and [straining](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#Cold%20Property%20Alteration) the metal like in [cold rolling](#cold%20rolling).
##### Cold Rolling
Cold forging requires a lot of torque to [deform](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md) the material. It is usually done through hammering the workpiece exclusively. The deformation is only achieved by [straining](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#Cold%20Property%20Alteration) the metal instead of reordening the crystal structure as in [hot rolling](#hot%20rolling).
#### Bending
##### Free Bending
A metal is bent in between two seperated blocks until it has a specific __curve__. This method has a lot of [springback](Young's%20Modulus.md) because the bend is spread in a smooth curve over the distance between blocks.
##### Die Bending
A metal is bent on a die to give a metal a specific __bend angle__. This method has very little springback because the bend is concentrated on a very small area.
##### Deep Drawing
A metal is bent along a die with a _[punch](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation)_ until it reaches a specific __depth__. This method usually happens in more than one step because the material has to bend and stretch a substantial amount. An example of a product made with this method are metal cans.

### Characteristics
This process is for __metals__ only. %%duhh%%
