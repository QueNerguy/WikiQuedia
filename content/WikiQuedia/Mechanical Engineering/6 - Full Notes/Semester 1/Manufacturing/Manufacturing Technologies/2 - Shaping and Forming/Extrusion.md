# Extrusion
### Process
The general process of extrusion involves forcing the [billet](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) through a [die](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) by pushing either one. This process is the reciprocal of [Drawing](Drawing.md). It can, however, be done both __hot__ and __cold__.
#### Types
##### Direct Extrusion
The [billet](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) gets pushed through the [die](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation). The force is applied to the billet into the die. This produces a lot of heat and friction because the billet both wants to expand in the chamber and has to adhere to the shape of the die and therefore has to [deform](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md) heavily, producing a lot of friction and thus heat.
##### Indirect Extrusion
The [die](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) gets pulled over the [billet](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation). This process produces less heat and friction than [direct extrusion](#direct%20extrusion), but because the billet has to [deform](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md) heavily to adhere to the die, the friction - and therefore heat - is still very substantial.
##### Hydrostatic Extrusion
The [billet](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) is surrounded by fluid when it's pushed. The force is applied to the fluid and because fluids cannot compress it gets transmitted completely but evenly over the whole of the billet. This also compresses the billet before entering the die, meaning there's less friction on the [die](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) itself. The layer of fluid between the billet and the chamber also means there's no friction between those two surfaces. The only source of friction and heat, then, is the connecting part between the die and the billet.
- Hydrostatic extrusion produces very little and heat and almost no friction, relative to [direct](#direct%20extrusion) and [indirect](#indirect%20extrusion) forms of extrusion.

### Characteristics
This process is for __metals__ and __plastics__ only. It is suitable for _thermoplasts_ and _elastomers_.
