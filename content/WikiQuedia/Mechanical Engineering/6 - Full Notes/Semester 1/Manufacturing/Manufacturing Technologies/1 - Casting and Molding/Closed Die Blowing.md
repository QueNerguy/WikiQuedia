# Closed Die Blowing
### Process
Blowing is applied after an [Extrusion](Extrusion.md) or [Drawing](Drawing.md) process to plastics to inflate them to their final size. They are inflated into a [die](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) until the walls have a constant thickness. Plastic bottles are made with this process for example.

### Characteristics
This process is for __plastics__ only. It suits _thermoplastics_ and _elastomers_. This is mostly because those are the only ones that can be [extruded](Extrusion.md) or [drawn](Drawing.md). In theory a thermoplast could also be blown.
##### Positive
- This process has fast cycle times
- Cheap
##### Negative
- The blowing process gives little agency over the quality of the end-product. <br>This process therefore has low accuracy.
