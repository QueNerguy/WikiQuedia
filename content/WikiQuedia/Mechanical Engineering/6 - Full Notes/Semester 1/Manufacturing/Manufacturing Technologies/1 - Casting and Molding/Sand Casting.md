# Sand Casting
### Process
In sand casting sand is used as the [mold](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) material. The mold consists of two parts that are clamped together when the metal is inserted. When creating the mold one [pattern](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) is first laid out in the sand on one side, and then another one on the other side. Then the molds are connected and metal is inserted[^sand]. The mold is consumed after __one__ - or only a few more than one - cycle.
To avoid failure of parts in the mold see the [design guidelines page](Design%20Rules%20Casting.md).

### Characteristics
This process is for __metals__ only.
##### Positive:
- This process allows for the manufacturing of very big parts.
- This process allows for very complicated shapes, complicated curves for example, in one dimension only though because the mold still has to be able to open.
- Low cost.
##### Negative
- This process is slow, setting up every new cycle costs a lot of time and only one product can be produced at a time.
- This process has low accuracy.
- The resulting products are very rough due to the sand texture.
- Some parts require touch up afterward to meet precision standards and smoothen out the surface.
