# Investment Casting
### Process
Investment casting happens in 4 steps: __Firstly__ a [mold](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) is created to mold a wax pattern. This could be made of metal, or precision printed plastic, etc., whichever technique suits the eventual product best. __Secondly__ the wax is created from this mold and assembled into a bigger [pattern](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation). __Thirdly__ this assembly is coated with a stucco coating to form the final mold of this process. The wax is subsequently molten out of this mold. __Fourthly__ metal is poured into the stucco mold. After the metal has cooled the stucco is broken for removal. This process consumes every last mold and pattern in the process _except for_ the mold that creates the wax pattern[^invest].
To avoid failure of parts in the mold see the [design guidelines page](Design%20Rules%20Casting.md).
### Characteristics
This process is for __metals__ only.
##### Positive
- All metals can be cast using this process
- This process can produce very intricate products.
- This process creates very accurate products.
##### Negative
- Expensive
- This process is limited by the size of the products it can create.
