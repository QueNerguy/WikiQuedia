# Design Rules Casting
When casting a product in a [mold](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) there is a risk of the product not filling all the gaps in the mold, cracking or having huge stress concentrations at certain areas, increasing the risk of failure and lowering the quality of the product.
To counter these issues consider the following design guidelines:
1. 
> [!check] Constant Thickness
> Make the thickness of walls as uniform throughout the design as possible. This prevents the forming of gaps and air bubbles in the final product and decreases stress concentration risks.

2. 
> [!check] Shallow Angles and Fillets
> When creating parts make sure that the angle between two connecting parts is as small as possible. Do this by adding fillets in between surfaces, changing square ribs to be hexagonal. Avoid angles of $\ge90\textdegree$ and even lower as much as possible.

3. 
> [!check] Add Drafts
> Surfaces that slide along the walls of the mold when opening the mold should have a slight draft angle. This reduces wear on the product and crack forming in the die.

4. 
> [!check] Cavities on One Side Only
> When creating big empty spaces in a model, make sure they are all on one side of the model. This allows for cheaper die manufacturing and allows the product to leave the  mold easier. It also reduces wear.
