# Laser Cutting
### Process
A high power laser is directed toward a very small point, focusing all the energy and creating such heat that the metal melts or vaporizes[^laser].
### Characteristics
This process is suitable for a multitude of materials, most notably __metals__ and __wood__ sheets.
##### Positive
- This process leaves a very small [heat affected zone](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#hot%20deformation).
- This process takes relatively little time.
- This process creates clean and smooth edges.
##### Negative
- This process doesn't work on reflective surfaces.
