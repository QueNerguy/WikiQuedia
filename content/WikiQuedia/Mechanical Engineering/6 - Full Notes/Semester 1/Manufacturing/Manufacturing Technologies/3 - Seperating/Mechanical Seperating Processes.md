# Mechanical Seperating Processes
### Characteristics
In contrast to [heat dependent parting processes](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#chemical%20and%20heat%20dependent), mechanical parting processes cause almost no crystal reordening and thus no properties are (significantly) changed at the edges of a cut.

###  Types
#### Slitting
A clamp and _bottom blade_ ensure the _[sheet metal](Sheet%20Metal%20Forming.md)_ stays in place while a blade cuts it. The balde moves through the metal right next to the bottom blade to create a shear force on a maximally small area to increasing the shear stress %%==LINKJE NAAR MECHOMAT==%% as much as possible. This parting method creates a very clean and smooth edge as it works almost analogously to [punching](#punching), only instead along a path.
#### Punching
A [punch](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) is used to create __hole__ through a metal object, typically sheet metal. The edge is typically very clean and smooth.
#### Sawing
A saw is used to part a [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation). This method of seperating usually leaves very rough edges on products where they are cut.
