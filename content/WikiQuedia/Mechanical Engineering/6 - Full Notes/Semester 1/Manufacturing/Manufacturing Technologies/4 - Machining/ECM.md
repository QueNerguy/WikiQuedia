# ECM
### Process
In ECM a cathode moves along the [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation), with an electrical charge shooting from the electrode to the workpiece, charging the workpiece. A small bit of the workpiece then dissolves with the ion-filled-fluid, an electrolyte, that it is submerged in. The fluid then carries away the waste products[^elec].
##### Similar Processes
This process is similar to [EDM](EDM.md), but it uses a chemical process to remove material, and it has the advantage of having no [tool](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) wear.

### Characteristics
This process is for __electrically conductive metals__ only.
This process produces no [heat induced property alteration](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md).
##### Positive
- This process is <u>very</u> precise and allows for the creation of complicated 3D shapes.
- This process works independent of the material hardness.
- This process does not consume the [tool](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation).
> [!abstract] Extra
This process is very suitable for mold creation and tool production because of it's incredible precision.
##### Negative
- This process operates at a low speed.
- This process requires electrically conductive metals.
- This process requires a bath and the fluid to entirely submerge the [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation), which means that big shapes are possible as long as the machine can reach the size, but production gets exponensially more expensive as size increases.
