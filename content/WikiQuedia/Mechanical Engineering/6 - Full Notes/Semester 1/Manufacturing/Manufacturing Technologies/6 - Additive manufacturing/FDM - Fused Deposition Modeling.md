# FDM - Fused Deposition Modeling
### Process
Fused deposition modelling (FDM), also known as _fused filament fabrication (FFF)_, more commonly known as the name of it's parent category, _3D printing_, is a [3D printing](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) process that layers liquified plastic filament over one another to create a 3D shape. It uses a printer head that moves in 3 dimensions that heats the filament, to make it soft and pliable, to print the product, while the table is stationary. 
This process is only suitable for thermoplasts and no other material. 
##### Use cases
Like [Power Bed Fusion](Power%20Bed%20Fusion.md) is for metals, Fused depostion modeling is a common process for prototyping stages, and, depending on the quality of the printer and the speed of the printer head, is also sometimes used for production of parts that bear almost no loads and would otherwise require some type of [Injection Molding](Injection%20Molding.md) process to manufacture.

### Characteristics
This process is for __thermoplastics__ only.
##### Positive
- This method _can_ operate at a high speed.
- This process _can_ be done for very cheap, making it great for prototyping purposes.
##### Negative
- The process leaves a very rough surface finish.
- This process requires supports for the printing of certain parts.
- This process is weak in the direction it was layered in (the $z$-axis).
