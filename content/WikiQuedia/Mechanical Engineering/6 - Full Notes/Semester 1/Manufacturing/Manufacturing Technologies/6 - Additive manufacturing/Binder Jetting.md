# Binder Jetting
### Process
In binder jetting a layer of material is deposited, always in powder form. This layer is followd by a layer of adhesive, and the process repeats. The depositing can be done in one of two ways:
1. ___Drop on Demand (DoD):___ In this process particles are placed only on the path. Only the material that will be part of the end-product is placed.
2. ___Continuous drop:___ In this process the whole layer is sprayed onto the base at the same time, followed by the adhesive bonding only that material that is part of the end-product.
In this process the head moves in the horizontal plane, and the table moves the [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) up and down[^bind1].
##### Similar Processes
This process is similar to [Material Jetting](Material%20Jetting.md), where only polymers are used, and they are cured with a laser instead.
### Characteristics
This process is suitable for __metals, polymers and ceramics__, but metals require [Sintering](Sintering.md) afterward. 
##### Positive
- This process has a high accuracy.
- This method allows for multiple materials and colors to be layered simultaneously.
- This method allows for metals, polymers, ceramics and more to be used, making it very versatile.
- This method can operate at a high speed.
##### Negative
- This process (seldomly) requires supports for the printing of certain parts.
- Not suitable for structural parts, because of the binder material being the source of strength in a part.
- This method has a rough surface finish and may require machining afterward.
