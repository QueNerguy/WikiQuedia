# Material Jetting
### Process
In material jetting a polymer is sprayed onto the base, and then selectively hardened. This process can happen in one of two ways:
1. ___Drop on Demand (DoD):___ In this process droplets are placed before the laser, on the path, which then moves over and hardens the polymer. Only the polymer that needs hardening is placed.
2. ___Continuous drop:___ In this process the whole layer is sprayed onto the base at the same time, followed by the laser selectively hardening a part of the droplets.
In this process the head moves in the horizontal plane, and the table moves the [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) up and down[^jet1].
##### Similar Processes
This process is similar to [Binder Jetting](Binder%20Jetting.md), where metals, polymers and ceramics can all be used and the material isn't cured but instead is held together by an adhesive.
### Characteristics
This process is for __polymers and waxes__ only.
##### Positive
- This process has a high accuracy.
- This method has a good surface finish.
- This method allows for multiple materials and colors to be layered simultaneously.
##### Negative
- This process requires supports for the printing of certain parts.
- The properties of the product change with time due to the nature of polymers.
- The products created with this process are weak in tension.
