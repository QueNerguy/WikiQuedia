# Resistance Welding
### Process
Resistance welding works by applying a high amperage through a metal. The resistance as the current moves from the one plate to the other causes such heat that [plasma](Plasma%20Working.md) is created and the metals melt and weld together.
##### Spot Welding
Spot welding is a very common method of resistance welding, where two _equaly thick_ plates are welded together at a point, by applying the current between two electrodes on the top and bottom of the plates.

### Characteristics
This process is for __electrically conductive metals__ only.
This process comes with relatively little [heat induced property alteration](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md).
##### Positive
- This process is very quick.
- This process is very easy to calculate.
- This process is very easy to apply.
- This process has a small [heat affected zone](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#hot%20deformation).
- This process produces very little [thermal distortion](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation).
##### Negative
- This process is not nearly as strong as other welding methods.
