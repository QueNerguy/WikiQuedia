# Oxyfuel Welding
### Process
In oxyfuel welding a flame, fueled by a gas made up of pure oxygen, is used to melt the metal pieces which joins them when the liquified metal pools cool[^gas].

### Characteristics
This process is for __metals__ only.
This process comes with a lot of [heat induced property alteration](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md).
##### Positive
- This process is quick.
- This process works for non-electrically-conductive metals.
##### Negative
- This process grants the welder little control over the quality of the weld, resulting in more inconsistent and generally weaker welds.
- This process requires gas release
- This process has a big [heat affected zone](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#hot%20deformation).
- This process can create significant [thermal distortion](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation).
