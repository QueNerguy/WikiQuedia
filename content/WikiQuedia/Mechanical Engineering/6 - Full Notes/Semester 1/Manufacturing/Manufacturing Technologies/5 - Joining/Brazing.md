# Brazing
### Process
In brazing only the _filler metal_ is molten to create the joint, unlike in [welding processes](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#welding), where the [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) and the optional filler metal both melt. This allows for a greater control over the tolerances and creates clean joints.Brazing, therefore, also works irrespective of the material type, as long as the melting temperature is higher than the filler metal melting point.
##### Similar processes
The process itself is most like [Oxyfuel Welding](Oxyfuel%20Welding.md) in that the source of heat is a gas propelled flame and not a plasma and electricity reliant process. This means that the workpiece does not need to be able to conduct electricity[^braz].

### Characteristics
This process is suitable for __all materials with a high enough melting point__.
##### Positive
- This process allows for a big range of material choices, as long as the melting point exceeds that of the filler metal.
- This process allows for great control over tolerances, because the [workpieces](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) do not melt themselves.
- This process has a small [heat affected zone](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#hot%20deformation).
- This process produces very little [thermal distortion](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation).
##### Negative
- Brazed joints are not as strong as welded joints, because of the soft filler material.
- This process requires the mating surfaces to be exceptionally clean and close together, as the molten filler metal moves through _capillary action_[^cap].
