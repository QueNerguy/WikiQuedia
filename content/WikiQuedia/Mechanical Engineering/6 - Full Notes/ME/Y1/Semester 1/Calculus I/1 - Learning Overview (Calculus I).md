# Learning Overview (Calculus I)
Calculus I lays out the base mechanics of differentiation and integration. The following list is in the order I would recommend consuming these subjects to learn calculus and it's concepts, with the most important part of understaning it being the [foreground](#foreground).
### Background
1. ___[Intervals; Domain and Range](Intervals;%20Domain%20and%20Range.md):___ These are the fundamentals to evaluating integrals, and terms that will be referred to in the text itself. A preview will show, directing to the proper chapter, will show when these terms are mentioned.
2. ___[Calculating Limits](Calculating%20Limits.md):___ Limits are the origin of differentiating. Understanding them is not necessarily integral to understanding the concepts of calculus itself, but it is usually an important part of a calculus book.
### Foreground
1. ___[Differentiation and Techniques](Differentiation%20and%20Techniques.md):___ This note explains how differentiating works, what it means to differentiate, geometrically, and it gives some rules and formulas to use when applying it's material.
2. ___[Integration and Techniques](Integration%20and%20Techniques.md):___ This note explains how integration works, what it means to integrate, geometrically, and it gives some rules and formulas to use when applying it's material.
### Afterwork
1. ___[Inverting a Function](Inverting%20a%20Function.md):___ This topic depends heavily on differentiation, but is not directly related to understanding the core concepts in the [foreground](#foreground) of calculus. It is, however, usually part of a calculus book.
