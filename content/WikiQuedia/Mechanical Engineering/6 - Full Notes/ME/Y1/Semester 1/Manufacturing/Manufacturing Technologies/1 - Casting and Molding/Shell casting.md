# Shell casting
__Centrifugal molding__ works the same, but the [dies](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) are hollow.
### Process
Shell casting uses resin covered sand to form the [mold](Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Hub#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation. To create the mold a [pattern](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation). The original [pattern](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) is inserted into a chamber where sand and resin are sprayed unto it. When the pattern is removed a _shell_ is left. This shell is then used to create the end-product. The shell is consumed when removing the end-product[^shell].
To avoid failure of parts in the mold see the [design guidelines page](Design%20Rules%20Casting.md).

### Characteristics
This process is for __metals__ only.
##### Positive
- This process has a high accuracy. Gears are made using this process for example.
- This process has a fast cycle time.
- Products have very good surface finish
- Can make slightly intricate parts
##### Negative
- Expensive
- This process is limited by the size of the products it can create.
