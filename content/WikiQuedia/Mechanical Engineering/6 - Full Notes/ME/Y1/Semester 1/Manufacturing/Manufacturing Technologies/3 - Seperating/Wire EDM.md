# Wire EDM
### Process
In wire <u>E</u>lectrical <u>D</u>ischarge <u>M</u>achining a wire moves through the metal like a [saw](Mechanical%20Seperating%20Processes.md#sawing) would, but without the reciprocating motion. Instead, an electrical charge runs from the wire to the [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation), forming plasma at the contact with the workpiece. The charge moves through an electrically conductive fluid. When the charge enters the workpiece plasma is created and a small bit of metal is removed from the workpiece, which is removed through the fluid, and the cycle repeats.
For this to work the workpiece has to be _submerged entirely_ in an electrically conductive fluid though.
##### Similar Processes
This process is closely related to [EDM](EDM.md), but it uses a saw-shaped electrode to remove the material, and the contour of the cut therefore follows that of the saw.

### Characteristics
This process is for __electrically conductive metals__ only.
##### Positive
- This process leaves <u>no</u> [heat affected zone](Crystal%20Manipulation%20and%20Deformation.md#hot%20deformation).
- This process leaves very smooth edges.
- This process is very precise.
- This process also works for blocks of metal, not just sheets.
##### Negative
- This process only works for conductive metals.
- This process operates at a low speed.
