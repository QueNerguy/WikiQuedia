# DED - Directed Energy Deposition
### Process
In directed energy deposition (DED) a metal wire is deposited through a nozzle and molten with either a laser or an electron beam upon contact with the [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation). The height of the table determines the height of the workheight of the laser or beamer, and the _nozzle_ moves in the horizontal plane. The nozzle can also be tilted change the angle from which the wire is fed[^dede].
##### Similar Processes
The process is similar to [fused deposition modeling](FDM%20-%20Fused%20Deposition%20Modeling.md), in that it builds layers by feeding a wire to adhere to the previous layers, but suitable for metals only.

### Characteristics
This process is for __metals and plastics__ only.
##### Positive
- This process has a high accuracy, and the material properties can be calculated with little error.
- This method _can_ operate at a high speed.
- This process requires no supports.
##### Negative
- This process leaves a rough surface finish and may require machining afterward.
