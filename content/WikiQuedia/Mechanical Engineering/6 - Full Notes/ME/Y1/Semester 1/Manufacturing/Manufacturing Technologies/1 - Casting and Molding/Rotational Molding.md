# Rotational Molding
### Process
The process is analagous to [injection molding](Injection%20Molding.md), but easier as the [mold](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) doesn't need to be filled by the pressure of the injection installation, but instead it's filled by centrifugal force.

### Characteristics
This process is for __metals__ and __plastics__, but _thermoplasts_ only.
##### Positive
- Cheap
- Products from this process have a good surface finish
- This process can create large parts
##### Negative
- This process is limited by the amount of shapes it can produce.<br>The objects have to be somewhat circular and the cavities cannot be perpendicular to the radius of rotation or they won't fill.
- The products from this process can't have variating wall thickness at all. The centrifugal motion makes all walls the same size.
- Moderate production speed. <br>This process can only create one product at a time and the cycle time is relatively high because filling the whole mold takes a while.
