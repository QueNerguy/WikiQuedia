**[Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra)** is the branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") that studies certain abstract [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System"), known as [algebraic structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_structures "Algebraic structures"), and the manipulation of [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics) "Expression (mathematics)") within those systems. It is a generalization of [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic "Arithmetic") that introduces [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics) "Variable (mathematics)") and [algebraic operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_operation "Algebraic operation") other than the standard arithmetic operations, such as [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition "Addition") and [multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication "Multiplication").
