- An _eigenvector_ is a vector that in a matrix multiplication is only stretched, not rotated or otherwise.
- An _eigenspace_ is a space in two dimensions or higher that is only stretched, not rotated or otherwise
- An _eigenvalue_ is the value that the eigenvector/eigenspace stretches.<br>Therefore eigenvalue $\cdot$ eigenvector replaces the matrix transformation (only for this specific vector or vectorspace ofcourse)

-  finding eigenvalues of a matrix means you solve the equation $\det\left(\left\lbrack A-\lambda I\right\rbrack\right)=0$. Finding eigenvalues means finding $A\textbf{x}=\lambda \textbf{x}$, which means: $A\textbf{x}-\lambda \textbf{x}=0 \rightarrow$ _$(A-\lambda) \textbf{x}=0$_. To eliminate the unknown $\textbf{x}$ from the equaton you take the determinant where it is nonzero, because the first equation is analagous to finding an non-invertible matrix for $\textbf{x}$, and a non-invertible matrix has a zero determinant.
