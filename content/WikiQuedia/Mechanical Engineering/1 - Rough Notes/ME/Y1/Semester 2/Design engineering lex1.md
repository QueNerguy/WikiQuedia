It is a decision making porcess in which the engineerring sciences are aplied to convert resources optimally to meet a stated objective.
- important elements of a design process are
	1. establishemtns of objectives and goals, or criteria
	2. ...

- Importatn workflow model for a designing process
	1. pahl & beitz <br>outdated model $\rightarrow$ :( <br>Will still be done in lectures tho fr
		1. __problem analysis:__ 
			1. topic
			2. important functions
			3. use case
			4. use time
		2. __requirements:__ issues required for operation. Things regarding lifetime, weight max, operation speed, size, etc. <br>Have to be <u>quantifiable</u>. $\rightarrow$ yes, no answers to meeting the standards, also needs numbers or something
		3. __Function analysis:__ description of what the product should do. This description requires a werkwoord i the sentence.
		4. __concept phase:__ generate clear overview of all possible solutions to the porblem. This phase focuses mostly on physical principles. 
			- A morphological diagram may be used to isolate different solutions to parts of a wokring machine. $\rightarrow$ create "sub-solutions"for "sub-functions" of the whole project. This means you odn't solve the whole porblem but focus on smaller parts that may or may not be viable ot complete the assignmetn. this encourages creativity. <br>From the morphological diagram solutions are chosen and combined into a bigger final concept.
			- There are different types of _methodical design_ available outside of a morphological diagram.
