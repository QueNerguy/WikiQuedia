### lecture 1 ethics
- ethicla problems arise when ther is a dilemma between tow issues where the question is which one is more morally salient.
- __Ethical cycle__
	1. __Case__
		- investigate (-> take an inverntory of) the case, the positives, negatives and different perspectives.
	2. __Moral problem statement__ <br>To create a statement you answer these following three questions:<br>A moral problem statement __only__ has to engage with the ==moral value==, not a fix or descriptive statement, or anything else.
		1. what is the moral problem? <br>-> in a moral _problem_ there are two conflicting values, in a moral _dilemma_ there are two options, both are not optimal -> you will do something wrong
		2. who has to act to fix?
		3. in what way is this problem _moral_?
	3. __Problem Analysis:__<br> This considers the points to take into account when solving the porblem
		- Stake- and shareholders in this problem
		- Relevant moral values
		- uncertain or missing facts <br> when the facts of the case are not all known it is sometimes necessary to make assumptions to solve the problem. When making these assumptions be very explicit, this way it is easier to solve or fill in the blanks upon the release of new information.
	4. __Options for actions:__
		- consider the options for taking actions, often yes or no do or do not, but sometimes coooperative options can yield interesting solutions.
	5. __
- ___Types___
	- __utilitarianism__ <br>The goodness of an action is entirely dependent on the goodness of it's consequences. Therefore no signel action can be wrong, as long as the consequences are positive -> the ends satisfy the means.
		- Whatever maximises happiness
		- happiness = presence of pleasure _and_ absence of pain
		- __To determine value:__
			1. Identify what is _intrinsically_ good. -> good for it's own sake -> "it insist upon itself type shit"
			2. Identify what is _intrisinsically_ bad
			3. Determine the <u>possible</u> options
			4. Determine the _value_ of the options and their results. -> how much intrinsical good and how much intrical bad will each option bring about?
			5. Pick the option with the best net value
	- __Kantianism__ <br>an action is only right if it is done from good will and out of respect for out moral duties. Therefore the consequences do not determine the rightness of an action, only the intention.
		- Wat je niet wil dat jou geschiedt, doe dat ook een ander niet.
		- The ends do <u>not</u> satisfy the means
	- __virtue ethics__ <br>Virtue ethics puts the person at the center of morality. What should you do? what a virtuous person would do.
