thermal equilibrium $\approx$ same temp

- Properties (mass or energy) change depending on time: __Transient__ system
- properties (mass or energy) dont change with time: __steady state__ system

__Quasi steady state/ Quasi equilibrium__
process remains close to the equilibrium temperature and the individual steps in the change are negligible. This is like weighing a brick bu adding eahc particle individually, after one another.<br><br>_Specific volume_ means $\frac{\text{volume}} {\text{mass}}$ 
_Specific heat_ is the amount of heat required to heat a substance with a mass of 1g by 1$\textdegree$K
$c_{v}$ = specific heat for constant volume.
$c_{p}$ = specific heat for constant pressure.
Specific gas constant $R=c_{p} - c_{v}$

##### Types of gasses
- __Perfect gas__: 
	1. intermolecular atrraction is zero
	2. negrligible volume
	3. Obeys ideal gas law applies
	4. het capacity is constant
- __ideal gas:__
	1. Heat capacity is dependont on the temperature.<br>an exanple is helium
- __Real gas:__
	1. only obeys gas laws in certain cases, like low temp and high pressure.
	2. volume and attraction between molecules are not negligible.<br>This is basically the opposite of a perfect gas.
	3. __Ideal gas law not applicable__

__Ideal gas law__
$PV = mRT$ with:
P = pressure
V= volume
m = mass
R = Specific gas constant (discussed earlier)
T = temperature

Ideal gas constant $R_{u} = 8.314\frac{J}{K\cdot mol}$ 

__pure substances__ are made up of only one chemical species $\rightarrow$ one atom type and composition type.
When a property in one state is known calulations can be made about the second state.

Only when a material has been fully converted to the next phase does the temperature of the material in- or decrease.

%%NEEDS SATURATION DOME, QUALITY (DRYNESS FACTOR)%%

a saturated state is a state where it's at a maximum energy before the material starts chanign phase (without a change in pressure or volume)

Dryness factor is ratio betweenthe amount of vapor and liquid
$$x=\frac{m_{vap\lor t}}{m_{liquid}+m_{vap\lor}}$$

Specific volume
$$v=\left(1-x\right)v_{f}+xv_{g}$$
types of phases:
liquid:
- supercooled/compressed liquid
- saturated liquid
- two phase fluid (two saturated fluids coexisting)
vapor:
- saturated vapor
- superheated vapor
