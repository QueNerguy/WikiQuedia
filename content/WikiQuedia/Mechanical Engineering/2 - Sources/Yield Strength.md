#### Synopsis:
Yield strength ($\sigma_{Y}$) measures the stress needed before plastic deformation sets in. This cannot be measured directly from a test like a tensile test and is therefore measured at $0.2\%$ [Strain](Strain.md) ($\sigma_{Y_{p 0.2}}$). __Measuring this:__ On a graph with $y$-axis the stress ($\sigma$) and $x$-axis the strain ($\varepsilon$), draw a line parallel to the straight part of the curve at $0.2\%$ strain. Where the line intersects with the rest of the graph is the yield strength ($\sigma_{Y_{p 0.2}}$).
