#### Synopsis:
Plasma is a state of matter that occurs under an intense heat and big electrical charge. This state is characterized mostly by a high level of ionization. The overall charge is mostly neutral, but within the material a lot of particles are charged. The exact boundaries are ill defined though.

- In industrial processes plasma either __1.__ occurs through an ionized concentrated stream of gas, or __2.__ at a contact between two materials, where the current has to change mediums.
1. In a concentrated stream of gas the process works by blowing an electrically conductive cloud toward the [workpiece](!%20Manufacturing%20Technologies%20Overview.md#Terms%20and%20Disambiguation) and running a current through it to the workpiece itself. This flow of electricity creates such heat and charge the the gas turns to plasma and the metal is molten, to either seperate or join parts by plasma cutting or welding them respectively.
2. In a change between two materials the transfer of the amperage from the one material to the next generates such resistance in the material that the metal is molten. Plasma is generated at the contact due to the heat and the presence of an electrical charge.

> [!note] Keep in mind
In order to use plasma to work on a product the product has to be able to cunduct electricity, therefore the material itself must be conducive but also the workbench which doubles as a ground for the electricity.
