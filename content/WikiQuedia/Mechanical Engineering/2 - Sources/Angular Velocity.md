#### Synopsis:
Angular velocity ($\boldsymbol{\omega}$ or $\dot{\boldsymbol{s}}$ as time derivative) measures speed around an axis as a rotation, or alternatively, the _rate of change with respect to time_ of distance in a rotation (the arc).
An object will always rotate around it's [Instant Centre of Rotation](Instant%20Centre%20of%20Rotation.md), no matter where the angular velocity acts, as long as it is subjected to _pure rotation_. Having only _angular_ velocities acting on a body causes pure rotation.
