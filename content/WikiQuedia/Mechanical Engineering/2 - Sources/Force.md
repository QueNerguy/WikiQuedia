#### Synopsis:
A force measures the tendency of an object or point to move in a straight line. A $0$ force means there's no acceleration, so the object either doesn't move, or moves at a constant speed. Statically these situations are equivalent.
A force can only cause a rotation if it works at a distance of the [instant centre of rotation](Instant%20Centre%20of%20Rotation.md), or at a distance of the element that is to be examined. In this case the rotation is caused by what is called a "projected [moment](Moment.md)".
