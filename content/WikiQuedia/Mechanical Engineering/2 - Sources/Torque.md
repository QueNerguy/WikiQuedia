#### Synopsis:
Torque, referred to in this document as $T$, measures an object's tendency to rotate. A $0$ torque means there's no [Angular Acceleration](Angular%20Acceleration.md), so the object either doesn't rotate, or rotates at a constant  [speed](Angular%20Velocity.md). Statically these situations are equivalent.
A torque is the equivalent of a [Force](Force.md) in a rotational motion. 
Usually a distinguishment is made between torques and [moments](Moment.md), but physically they act the same on an object. A torque is a moment that __1:__ twists the object, or __2:__ a rotation - or rotational tendency - that is caused by _pure_ rotation.
