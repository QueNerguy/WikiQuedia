# WikiQuedia

This is the github repository for Wikiquedia. [This the actual hosted website]https://quenerguy.github.io/WikiQuedia).

## Overview
WikiQuedia is a side project of mine where I store all my notes from my bachelor Mechanical Engineering at the Vrije Universiteit and University of Twente. 
The goal of this project is for me to have a database I can reference whenever I forget subjects or information, without having to search tediously through pages and pages of books, and having it update and sync across my devices. The explanations covered here are ones I find give a useful interpretation of the subject matter next to covering the standard textbook explanation. Even though I made this mainly for personal use, I decided to host it online so friends and otherwise can use or reference it as desired.

Because this is a personal project I take no responsibility for regular upkeep, I work on it when I have time and motivation, and I dont take responsibility for accuracy of the information. I will try to keep it as accurate as possible, but the timestamps and references are included in the pages, so if that information doesnt check out or is outdated then neither does the page.

# Quartz v4

> “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
